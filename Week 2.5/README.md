# Java
> Create a function that returns true when x is equal to y; otherwise, return false.  
>   
> Examples  
> isSameNum(4, 8) ➞ false  
> isSameNum(2, 2) ➞ true  
> isSameNum(42, 32) ➞ false  
>   
> Notes  
> Don't forget to return the result.

# JavaScript
> Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and return the result.  
>   
> Examples  
> addition(0) ➞ 1  
> addition(9) ➞ 10  
> addition(-3) ➞ -2  
>
> Notes  
> Don't forget to return the result.

# C#
> Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.  
>   
> Examples  
> CircuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300  
> CircuitPower(110, 3)  ➞ 330  
> CircuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600  
>   
> Notes  
> Power = Voltage * Current

# Python
> Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.    
>   
> Examples  
> tri_area(3, 2) ➞ 3  
> tri_area(7, 4) ➞ 14  
> tri_area(10, 10) ➞ 50  
>
> Notes  
> - The area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2.
> - Don't forget to return the result.
